              The sun casts oblique rays of the gentle warmth down upon campus as you 
              exit your last class of the afternoon. <br>

              The soft golden glow, the soothing fabric of your scarf, the long, dark shadows 
              cast by campus oaks, the coldness of the crisp spring air, the raw feeling of 
              simply existing, they surround you, enveloping not just you, but also the girl 
              with the red mittens walking a few paces behind, the two instructors with coffees 
              in hand approaching from your left, the young man briskly cycling past. <br>

              They surround and envelop the tired students running more on caffeine than on sleep, 
              the cheerful students partying alongside their close friends, the anxious students 
              waiting to hear back regarding their interview, the new students two quarters fresh 
              into college, the veteran students two months away from graduation. <br>

              These sensations which surround everyone and everything remind you, and remind us 
              all, of the uniqueness of existing here, and of the community that we call home. <br>

              After having a brief moment of existential reflection, you realize that you cannot 
              just stand in the center of the quad forever. It would be rather difficult to do 
              much schoolwork just standing there in the cold. Or any further thinking, for that
