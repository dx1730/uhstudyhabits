Thank for visiting our github link. This was a project made by Jake Wei, David Xue, Tessie Dong, Andi Li, and all those that helped me as part of Uncommon Hacks 2022
This is a story-based survey that takes you through a day in a life of uhicago student and determine what your study archytype is. 
  
Simply download and host the html file on your localhost(we are trying to move it to studymonke.tech at the moment). We hope that this is a nice blend of programatic art, 
music and creative storytelling for those that stumble upon this. We are priotizing the experience here and hopefully you find it as interesting as we found it rewarding to code.

(note)
You can also visit http://studymonke.x10.mx/. Although it only works on computers right now. 


Thanks again!
