Thank for visiting our github link. This was a project made by Jake Wei, David Xue, Tessie Dong, Andi Li, and all those that helped us as part of Uncommon Hacks 2022

This is a story-based survey that takes you through a day in a life of uhicago student and determine what your study archytype is. It will offer some recommendations and find you a perfect study along the way.
  
Simply download and host the html file on your localhost(we are trying to move it to studymonke.tech at the moment). We hope that this is a nice blend of programatic art, 
music and creative storytelling for those that stumble upon this. Feel free to put on some headphoens and hopefully you'll find it as interesting as we found it rewarding to code.

(note)
You can also visit http://studymonke.x10.mx/. Although it only works on computers right now. 
also...maybe don't press tab throughout the thing :)(its a bug we know, but we didn't have enough time to debug)


Thanks again!
