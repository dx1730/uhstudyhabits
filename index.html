                Sunlight sneaks past the blinds, casting a soft glow upon the small room you call home. 
                Half awake, you feel the warmth of the bed and the soothing familiarity of your surroundings, 
                the brick and concrete sheltering you from the frigid air outside. <br> <br>
                
                The fragmented memories of last night’s dream fade out of your mind as concentration and focus take their place. 
                A shame, it was a good dream, but even though the details are lost, a vague sense of 
                happiness remains. “At least it was a happy dream,” you think to yourself as you get ready 
                for class. You’ll even have time to indulge in breakfast today. <br> <br>

                While you enjoy all of them, you only have one bottle. What will you have this morning?

                As simple as your college life may seem, you are looking forward to tackling the everyday 
                challenges that may become the highlights, and mishaps, of your day. With your bottle full 
                and your bag packed, you head out the front door, greeted by the cold, refreshing air. <br> <br>

              The lecture hall is not precisely where you want to be right now, but work must be done and in due time, 
              your diligence will surely pay off. You claim the seat you often sit in, not too far that you’ll spend all of 
              lecture unfocused, but not so close that you can hear the instructor’s breathing. You grasp onto the fragments
              of conversation dancing around the room, find mild entertainment in catching brief whiffs of campus happenings 
              and the intricacies of the lives of others, listen to everyone and everything as all individuals merge into one voice. <br> <br>

              Perhaps you are not the best notetaker, but at least it will keep you focused in class, so you reach into your bag.

              <button onClick="vslide('next', 'dist')">“I’m running out of paper in this notebook, and my highlighters are almost done too.” Note-taking is an artform, and you are the artist. Gel pens and highlighters on college-rule are the medium.</button>
              <button onClick="vslide('next', 'pro')">“It’s okay. I’ll pay more attention without anything in front of me to distract, and the lecture notes will be online later today anyways.” Truly the minimalist approach..</button>
