                Sunlight sneaks past the blinds, casting a soft glow upon the small room you call home. 
                Half awake, you feel the warmth of the bed and the soothing familiarity of your surroundings, 
                the brick and concrete sheltering you from the frigid air outside. <br> <br>
                
                The fragmented memories of last night’s dream fade out of your mind as concentration and focus take their place. 
                A shame, it was a good dream, but even though the details are lost, a vague sense of 
                happiness remains. “At least it was a happy dream,” you think to yourself as you get ready 
                for class. You’ll even have time to indulge in breakfast today. <br> <br>

                While you enjoy all of them, you only have one bottle. What will you have this morning?

                As simple as your college life may seem, you are looking forward to tackling the everyday 
                challenges that may become the highlights, and mishaps, of your day. With your bottle full 
                and your bag packed, you head out the front door, greeted by the cold, refreshing air. <br> <br>

                You find yourself reaching for your headphones. “Maybe I should listen to something.”
