                Half awake, you feel the warmth of the bed and the soothing familiarity of your surroundings, 
                the brick and concrete sheltering you from the frigid air outside.

                A shame, it was a good dream, but even though the details are lost, a vague sense of 
                happiness remains. “At least it was a happy dream,” you think to yourself as you get ready 
                for class. You’ll even have time to indulge in breakfast today.

              The lecture hall is not precisely where you want to be right now, but work must be done and in due time, 
              your diligence will surely pay off. You claim the seat you often sit in, not too far that you’ll spend all of 
              lecture unfocused, but not so close that you can hear the instructor’s breathing. You grasp onto the fragments
              of conversation dancing around the room, find mild entertainment in catching brief whiffs of campus happenings 
              and the intricacies of the lives of others, listen to everyone and everything as all individuals merge into one voice. <br> <br>

              Perhaps you are not the best notetaker, but at least it will keep you focused in class, so you reach into your bag.

              choice and freedom. <br> <br>

              Lecture crawls along as you count the seconds away. Yet as you walk out of the lecture hall 
              you realize that time slipped by faster than you expect, reflected by the wispy clouds that 
              have made their way into the sky, and the vague feeling of hunger in your stomach. Lunch 
              seems to be in order. <br>

              The sun casts oblique rays of the gentle warmth down upon campus as you 
              exit your last class of the afternoon. <br>

              The soft golden glow, the soothing fabric of your scarf, the long, dark shadows 
              cast by campus oaks, the coldness of the crisp spring air, the raw feeling of 
              simply existing, they surround you, enveloping not just you, but also the girl 
              with the red mittens walking a few paces behind, the two instructors with coffees 
              in hand approaching from your left, the young man briskly cycling past. <br>

              They surround and envelop the tired students running more on caffeine than on sleep, 
              the cheerful students partying alongside their close friends, the anxious students 
              waiting to hear back regarding their interview, the new students two quarters fresh 
              into college, the veteran students two months away from graduation. <br>

              These sensations which surround everyone and everything remind you, and remind us 
              all, of the uniqueness of existing here, and of the community that we call home. <br>

              After having a brief moment of existential reflection, you realize that you cannot 
              just stand in the center of the quad forever. It would be rather difficult to do 
              much schoolwork just standing there in the cold. Or any further thinking, for that 
              matter. <br>
